# SystemTron-Analog_Digital_clock
# ⏰ Analog & Digital Clock using Python (Tkinter GUI)

This project demonstrates two graphical clock applications built using Python and Tkinter:

- 🕒 **Analog Clock** with real-time moving hour, minute, and second hands.
- ⏱️ **Digital Clock** displaying the current system time in HH:MM:SS format.

---

## 📁 Project Files

- `digital_clock.py` – Displays a digital clock using Python's `strftime()`.
- `analog_clock.py` – A functional analog clock using `Canvas` and trigonometry.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Tkinter (GUI library)  
- Cross-platform (Windows/macOS/Linux)  
- Editor: Visual Studio Code

## 🖥️ How to Run the Project



Check if Python is installed :


python --version

---
Install Tkinter (if not already installed) :


pip install tk

---

Run the digital clock :

python digital_clock.py

---

Run the analog clock :

python analog_clock.py



---

## 📷 Screenshots

This project contains two Python GUI clock files:

- **analog_clock.py** – A functional analog clock with moving hands
- **digital_clock.py** – A digital clock that shows current time in HH:MM:SS format

You can run each file to see the output on your screen.

*(Screenshots not included in this version of the project. Please run the files to see their GUI output.)*
