# SystemTron-Analog-Digital-Clock

# ⏰ Analog & Digital Clock using Python (Tkinter GUI)

This project demonstrates two graphical clock applications built using Python and Tkinter:

- 🕒 **Analog Clock** with real-time moving hour, minute, and second hands.
- ⏱️ **Digital Clock** displaying the current system time in HH:MM:SS format.
